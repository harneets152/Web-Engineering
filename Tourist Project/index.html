Many of its residents or fellow Angelinos know it for its film industry, hectic traffic, tourist attractions, and it&rsquo;s diversity in food. Many may consider Los Angeles to be a Coastal City since it&rsquo;s fairly close to a large body of water known as the Pacific Ocean. However many people may think of it as an urban area as it’s densely populated in locations around the city such as Korea Town, Little Ethiopia, Little Armenia, and many more areas within the city of Los Angeles. Accompanying these areas are other districts, noticeable districts include Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Long Beach, and many more districts.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>
      <h4>Pre&ndash;colonial history</h4>
      <p> Los Angeles, specifically the coastal area was inhabited by the Tongva and Chumash Tribes. These tribes had found Los Angeles in the village of Yaanga which meant &ldquo;poison oak place&rdquo;. As indigenous people struggled to find a semblance of a normal life through this new world, explorers also co&ndash;existed and sought to find more land. These explorers were conducting their own expedition missions and a Maritime explorer named Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed Southern California for the Spanish Empire around 1542. This was done while he was on a military expedition that was along the Pacific coast. It&rsquo;s implied that the first convert would&rsquo;ve happened after 1769 since a Franciscan missionary named Juan Crespí arrived at Los Angeles during that time. </p>
      <h4>Spanish Rule</h4>
      <p> In 1771 a Franciscan friar named Junípero Serra directed the first building of the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, which was the first mission in the area. In September of 1781, a group of settlers known as &ldquo;Los Pobladores&rdquo; founded a pueblo and it&rsquo;s known today as El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de Los Ángeles (The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels). Today the city of Los Angeles has the largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the U.S. By 1820, the population had increased to 650 residents which consisted of two&ndash;thirds of the Mexican or New Spain settlers who were either mestizo, mulatto, a mixture of African, indigenous, or of European ancestry.</p>
      <h4>Mexican Rule</h4>
      <p> There&rsquo;s not alot of information currently around for this era of Los Angeles. However, historians at this time know that New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire around 1821. It&rsquo;s also implied that the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico which the Governor formally expressed interest in and made Los Angeles Alta California&rsquo;s regional capital. </p>
      <h4>1847 to Present</h4>
      <p> During the Mexican&ndash;American War, Americans took back this area from Mexican rule after a series of battles which ultimately ended with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. The transcontinental South Pacific line from New Orleans to Lose Angeles was completed in 1876 and later the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885. Fossil fuels such as petroleum were found in the city and the surrounding area in 1892. The population by 1900 had grown to more than 102,000 which brought attention to the city&rsquo;s water supply. The Los Angeles Aqueduct was completed in 1913 by Willliam Mulholland which is where the name Mulholland Drive comes from. By 1923 these discoveries helped California become the country&rsquo;s largest oil producer. </p>
      <p> Los Angeles is also known to have created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the U.S. By September of 1908, the Los Angeles City Council promoted residential and industrial land to use zones. They established 3 residential zones of a single type, all of these zones prohibited industrial uses. Laws were enforced against industrial properties after knowing that some of these zones had barns, lumber yards, and machine&ndash;powered equipment. Between 1908 and 1915, the Council introduced various exceptions for these three residential zones and as a result, some industrial uses arose. In 1910 Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 film companies that were operational. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the film industry was solely in Los Angeles. Money that was generated by the film industry kept the city at bay from economic losses during the Great Depression. By 1930 the population had passed one million residents and 2 years later the city hosted the Summer Olympics. </p>
      <p> Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing during World War 2 and it was primarily involved with shipbuilding and aircraft. It was the headquarter for six of the country&rsquo;s major aircraft manufacturers at one point in time. Between 1930 and 1940, Los Angeles was the leader in agriculture and this is partly due to Los Angeles&rsquo;s outreach to other surrounding areas such as San Fernando Valley. The Interstate Highway System also expanded and developed during the 1950s and the 1960s which helped suburban growth but also marked an end to the city&rsquo;s electric rail system which was the largest in the world at one time. An indirect result of the war caused an unpredictable spiral of growth and that led to many amusements parks being built to sustain the growing population in relation to entertainment. </p>
      <p> In 1965, racial tension arose and it led to the Watts riots which resulted in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries. The first ARPANET transmission which was the birthplace of the internet took place in California, specifically the University of California, Los Angeles and it traveled to the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park. Tom Bradley was elected as the first African American Mayor in 1973 and he served for 5 years. Later in 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympics for the second time and it was boycotted by Communist countries. Despite the boycott, the event was profitable and more successful than the previous Summer Olympics. In April of 1992, racial tensions arose once again with the jury of four LAPD officers that were caught on tape beating Rodney King and this started an uproar of violent riots. In 1994 the Northridge earthquake happened and it&rsquo;s implied that it was a magnitude of 6.7 which caused $12.5 billion of damage and 72 deaths. Los Angeles announced that it will be hosting the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games and it&rsquo;s important to note that it&rsquo;s the third city to hold the Olympics 3 times.</p>
